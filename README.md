# Configuring Botty üîß
Botty has an easy-to-change constants file, called `constants.js` in the root of the server. Here's what you can change:

## General
*General configuration*
- `PORT`: where the Botty server should listen.

  
- `RESPONSES_FILE_PATH`: the file location of the dataset file Botty should source it's responses from. Expects a csv file with keys matching **RESPONSES_INPUT_KEY** and **RESPONSES_OUTPUT_KEY**.
  

- `USER_MESSAGE_EVENT`: the event string Botty listens to for user socket messages.
  

- `BOT_MESSAGE_EVENT`: the event string Botty will emit for it's reponse messages.
  

- `BOT_TYPING_EVENT`: the event string Botty will emit when typing a response. If `MAX_TYPING_S` is falsy, this event will never be emitted.

## Natural Defaults 
*Things to make Botty seem more real*

- `DEFAULT_RESPONSE`: the message Botty replies with if it finds no response matches.
  

- `RESPONSE_MATCH_THRESHOLD`: Botty response-matching tolerance. The lower this value, the looser the matches. 
  

- `MIN_TYPING_S`: the minimum value Botty should 'type' for, in seconds.
  

- `MAX_TYPING_S`: the maximum value Botty should 'type' for, in seconds. Set this to 0 to skip typing events.
  

- `MIN_NATURAL_PAUSE_S`: the minimum pause Botty will take before emitting it's first event, in seconds.
  

- `MAX_NATURAL_PAUSE_S`: the maximum pause Botty will take before emitting it's first event, in seconds.

# Extending Botty's Responses ‚úçÔ∏è
Botty has a default dataset file called `response_dataset.csv`. This is easily extendable, or you can provide your own. If you want to bring your own file, simple change the value of the `RESPONSES_FILE_PATH` constant and make sure it's in the correct format (see constants above). 

*Feel free to open a pull request to extend the default file.*
